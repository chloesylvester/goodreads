*Placed my R code and man files within their own branches instead of being on the main branch. The only file within the main branch should be the README.md file*

GoodreadsR is a package designed to help users analyze and visualize their reading habits. The goal of this package is to turn raw book data (from a .csv file) and turn it into useful information that can reflect a persons reading behavior.

Installation instructions:
  devtools::install_github("yourusername/GoodreadsR") will allow the user to export     their Goodreads file. To download your data, go into your Goodreads account under     Settings -> Export Library. 

Usage examples:
  Import and clean Goodreads data
  Summarize reading habits
  Visualize favorite books genres
  Compare two users (will have to adjust the code if you want to include other users   data)

Install with: install_github("chloesylvester/GoodreadsR")
